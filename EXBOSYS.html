        <p><h2>Problem Solved:</h2></p>
        <p><h3>
            Nowadays, there is water scarcity in the world and many buildings are catching fire and normally, 
            they are using water sprinklers for extinguishing fire where a lot of water is wasted with the wastage
            of time. But if the fire is caused due to petroleum or shot circuit, we cannot use water sprinklers as a common extinguisher.
            For that reason now a day's people are using fire extinguishing bomb for extinguishing fire but it is very harmful as
            it contains compressed carbon dioxide gas and if a person inhales this gas he/she may die. But there is no
            system made till now which can launch the bomb automatically towards the fire at the minimum time; using the maximum
            speed to transmit the data to the necessary addresses like the fire station, neighboring area, family members
            ; to prevent the human beings from injury or suffocation. And if we use the fire extinguishing bomb without our system, then
            the room will be covered with carbon dioxide gas which will cause a lot of suffocation in the room and even cause
            death if the person is unable to come out of the room in perfect time or if the person has not worn the
            safety masks and the glasses.
