                <p><h3>
                     As we all know food matters for everyone .
                     But in this world not everyone gets food .In other words not everyone has
                     a job .There are many reasons of being jobless .Three such reasons being-illness, gender discrimination
                     and aging. There are many poor handicapped people who cannot earn their livelihood, there are women who
                     cannot feed their babies and then there are old people who are suffering .People, who do not have a job,
                     do not have food either and have to go through starvation almost every other day. So we decided to make a robot
                     to solve this big problem. When we think about the most basic job in India then the answer immediately comes to
                     our mind-AGRICULTURE. Agriculture is such a job that needs a lot of hard work but ultimately will lead
                     to a sweet end. But if we reduce the hard work and make agriculture easy then it will be very helpful. So we
                     made a robot that will make agriculture downright easy.
